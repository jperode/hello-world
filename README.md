# hello-world
learning git for the sake of keeping track of what I do with life henceforth, with the time I have left, with org-mode on Emacs
I have to write something about emacs, it's history, it's longevity, life and its youth. How Org-mode has added to the viour of Emacs with the allure it brings. Emacs and org mode are making people, specifically productivity junkies, blush!
What more?
